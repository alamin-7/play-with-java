# Java Virtual Machine

In this section, we will explore the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and its role in the Java ecosystem.

Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a software program that runs Java bytecode on a computer. It is a crucial component of the Java platform, as it allows Java code to be executed on any platform that has a JVM implementation, without the need for recompilation. The JVM is responsible for loading, linking, and executing Java classes, as well as managing memory and resources.
